# Thomas James - Portfolio


---

## Description

A Portfolio Page that Showcases my Web Development Work.

- Portfolio shows developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.

- Links in navigation scroll to corresponding sections.

- Link to the section about work scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.

- Image of developer's first application, when presented, should be larger in size than the other applications.

- Images of applications should link to and display deployed applications when clicked.

- Resizing of the page or viewing the site on various screens and devices reveals a responsive layout that adapts to the site visitor's viewport.
